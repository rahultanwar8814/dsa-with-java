1. **Arrays and Strings**:
   -a Find the maximum or minimum element in an array.
   -b Reverse an array or string.
   -c Find duplicate elements in an array.
   -d... Find the intersection or union of two arrays.
   - Implement various string manipulation functions (e.g., reversing a string, checking for anagrams).

2. **Linked Lists**:
   - Implement a singly or doubly linked list and perform basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
   - Detect a loop in a linked list and find the starting point of the loop.
   - Reverse a linked list.
   - Merge two sorted linked lists.
   - Find the middle element of a linked list.

3. **Stacks and Queues**:
   - Implement a stack or a queue and its operations.
   - Evaluate postfix or infix expressions using a stack.
   - Implement a queue using stacks.
   - Solve problems involving bracket balancing and stack manipulation.

4. **Trees and Graphs**:
   - Implement a binary tree and perform tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder).
   - Determine if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).
   - Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
   - Perform graph traversal (BFS and DFS).
   - Detect cycles in a graph.
   - Find the shortest path in a graph (e.g., Dijkstra's or BFS for unweighted graphs).

5. **Sorting and Searching**:
   - Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort).
   - Implement searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).
   - Solve problems involving searching and sorting, such as finding the kth largest element in an array.

6. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Solve problems using dynamic programming techniques, like Fibonacci numbers, coin change, and the knapsack problem.
   - Understand and apply concepts of memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming.

7. **Recursion and Backtracking**:
   - Solve problems that involve recursion and backtracking, like the N-Queens problem and generating permutations.
 
8. **Complexity Analysis**:
    - Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
